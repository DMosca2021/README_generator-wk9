# Week 9 README.md Generator

## Description
This weeks homework was used to showcase my knowledge of node.js and being able to install and use dependencies like inquirer to create a README file via user input. These skills will be essential to understanding OOP as we move forward in class. One of the main challenges I encountered with this homework was getting the markdown to look correct after the README had generated.
